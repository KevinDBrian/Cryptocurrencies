# **Overview**
This project's goals was to take the data from the `crypto_data.csv` and process it to work with the unsupervised machine learning clustering models. 

There were four things that needed to be completed:
1.  Preprocess the data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
2.  Reduce data dimensions using PCA
3.  Cluster using K-Means
4.  Visualize results

# **Results**
These images are captures of the outputs from the [crypto_clustering.ipynb](crypto_clustering.ipynb) file.
